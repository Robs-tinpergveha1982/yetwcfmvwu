Duuuude, just watched Raid 2 and holy wow, what even was that?! Like, seriously, my brain is kinda fried right now, in a good way tho, you know? It’s insane! The fight scenes are nuts, like who even choreographs that stuff?! My entire body hurt just watching those guys.

And yeah, lemme tell you, downloading the movie was SO worth it. I mean, started a little slow, but then bam, when it picks up, it’s like being hit by a frickin’ freight train. Gotta say, that kitchen fight? Insane. I’m pretty sure I forgot to breathe for five straight minutes. 

Oh, and that Hammer Girl? Brutal. Like, c'mon, where did she even come from? She has hammers in her coat, man! I was just sitting there watching the movie and kept shouting, “Did you SEE that?!” at my poor cat, haha.

> Btw, I still have adrenaline blasting through my veins, no joke. People just kept coming at each other, I couldn't even look away, not even for popcorn refill. Kinda makes me want to learn some martial arts, twirl a stick around or something, but let’s be real, I’d probably just end up breaking at least two lamps and a toe, minimum.

You know what’s wild? The car chase. That camera work, though! How did they even manage that? It’s like it was glued to the action or something, made me feel like I was in the car dodging bullets. Too intense for this couch potato, but worth every second!

Anyway, enough babbling from me, just had to get this out there. Never thought I'd see a movie like that, you know? Pure action bliss, if that makes any sense. Okay, brain is too mushy for more coherent thoughts, so yeah, signing off for now.

Feeling like I'm still in the brawl, might just need a nap to shake this off. Catch ya later!
